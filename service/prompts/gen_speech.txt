Respond speech content only without any explanation, pay attention to the following:
1. You only greet audience once at the beginning of your speech. Pay attention to `page before` and `page after` to avoid repeat greeting.
2. Pay attention to the `cornerstone` idea, it is the main idea of your speech.
3. Pay attention on how you should transition from `page before` to `current page`.
